- For FMC APIs you need to create a user in FMC dashboard to access the API:
    - Username
    - Password
    - Get the DOMAIN_UUID

- 3 ways to consume FMC Rest APIs
    (A) FMC API EXPLORER
        Navigating to:
            https://<ipaddress>/api/api-explorer

    (B) POSTMAN APPLICATION

    (C) PYTHON SCRIPTS
        - first generate a token using *POST* request
            - the request contains your username and password created in FMC dashboard
        - you can also generate a REFRESH TOKEN
        - subsequent calls are made with the tokens.
        
        RUN CLI SCRIPTS IN THIS REPO
            python requestToken.py <username> <password> <ip_address>
            python getNetObjs.py <username> <password> <ip_address>
            python getAllDevices.py <username> <password> <ip_address>
